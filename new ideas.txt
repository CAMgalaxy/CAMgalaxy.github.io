- increase thickness

- usability study of researchers -> what do they need?


- stepsize valences
- if pos / neg affordance set valence
- start with neutral

- pre-processing: check emotional coherence 
> ask them why within software

- add maybe in future: https://ivis-at-bilkent.github.io/cytoscape.js-cise/demo.html

- strength: add low, middle, high to slider // OR slider with markings // OR slider from [-3,3] + ambivalent checkbox + markings (change colour of slider, add triangle // coloured points)


Using Software -> Link to video

? rationale ? concepts smaller / larger -> importance

to test: more connection => more important / more comperable

- external validity -> Lucas MA
- internal validity -> 
questi <-> CAMs (simple topic like speed limitation and check if 120kmh is pos / neg, ...) 
inter-rater-reliability similarity of pairwise CAMs (! not really helping for ~reliability of CAMs) -> was meinen wir hier eigentlich?

- usability research -> design
plattform: 99design?
